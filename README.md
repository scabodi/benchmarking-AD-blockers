# Benchmarking analysis of browser AD-blockers

This work is the result of an internship of 4 months (Nov 2017 - Feb 2018) at Ermes Cyber Security s.r.l., Turin, Italy.
Under the Python folder, one can find the scripts developed to gather, analyse, compare and plot the performace results of some AD blockers, competitor of the company. 
The aim was to evaluate the performances in terms of time and number of objects downloaded during a page visit. For this purpose, I visited 'heavy' web pages, like newspapers, turism agencies and others, both in Chrome and Firefox browsers. 
The development was done in a Linux environment, specifically Ubuntu 16.04, using Python programming language. 

The PDF file is the paper describing the work done and it is also my BS thesis. The document is available in Italian.
